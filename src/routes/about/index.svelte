        The Breaking Bad API is a collection of information on the Vince Gilligan series Breaking Bad,
        as well as his incredible spin-off Better Call Saul. This site is designed to make it easy on
        the developer to see what HTTP requests are possible, and what information is available.

        Breaking Bad is regarded as one of the greatest television series of all time, and with 16 Primetime Emmy
        Awards, it is worthy of it's own API.
